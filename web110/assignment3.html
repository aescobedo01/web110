<p>The lesson called Search Better is helpful because it discusses how to use the search bar by offering user-friendly tips. One common misconception about making a search is that complex questions can result in accurate answers. However, this is confusing because searching with long and broad terms can give unwanted results. Using specific keywords instead of long questions helps narrow the search down to the most accurate and direct answers. This can be useful in my daily life because I enjoy niche K-pop groups that sometimes have vague names, such as Rainbow and Stellar. By searching up short and specific terms such as “rainbow kpop girl group” I can find the most accurate results possible.</p> 
<p>    Additionally, learning about using the Wayback Machine is very helpful to view archives. The Wayback Machine is a website that archives snippets of old or existing web pages. It shows a timeline of all archived pages from the first archive to the last archive.  For example, if you type in a website name or keyword into the search bar, you can select the website you are looking for from a list of similar webpages. This was useful to my knowledge because while navigating the Wayback Machine, I discovered a forgotten K-pop group via a log from November 3, 2005 on kpop-jpop.com, which is a website that no longer exists.</p>
<p>	Searching with exact phrases on any search engine can assist in finding web pages with the exact information needed. I can get extremely accurate results by putting quotes around words that must be included in the search results. I looked up “search engine” and “market share” with and without the quotes around it and achieved very different results. For market share with and without quotes, the top results were similar, with articles titled “What is market share?”.  For search engine without quotes, the top results were articles titled “Other search engines that are not Google”. With quotes, the top results were similar, but there was one Wikipedia article about search engines titled “Search Engine”.</p>
