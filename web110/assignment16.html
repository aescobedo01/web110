                <p>
                    LOONA is an 11 (formerly 12) member girl group from Blockberry Creative.
                    Their concept is very unique in k-pop. It involved debuting each member individually, then as
                    subunits, before debuting the
                    entire group. Heejin debuted first on October 5, 2016, and Olivia Hye debuted last on
                    March 20, 2018. LOONA has 3 subunits, with subunit LOONA 1/3 debuting on March 13, 2017, with the
                    extended
                    play Love and Live. Subunit ODD EYE CIRCLE debuted on September 21, 2017, with their extended play
                    titled
                    Mix &amp; Match. Subunit yyxy debuted May 30, 2018, with the extended play Beauty &amp the Beat.
                    LOONA officially debuted August 20,
                    2018 with their first extended play [+ +], featuring the hit single, <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/c-ByukR8cVo" class="songs">Hi High</a>. The repackage, [X X], was
                    released on February 19, 2019 and featured their best known single <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/YvuOhU_Evyg" class="songs">Butterfly</a>. They went on to release [#],
                    [12:00], [&amp], and Flip That for their Korean discography. Their Japanese debut was on
                    September 15, 2021, with the single Hula Hoop.
                    In December 2021, member Chuu
                    filed for an injunction to terminate her
                    contract with Blockberry Creative due to unpaid wages.
                    In March 2022, she won a partial injunction. In June 2022, LOONA released their summer special Fl!p
                    That. On August 1st, 2022, LOONA kicked off their 1st world tour. In September 2022, member Yeojin
                    revealed that all LOONA members had never been paid any wages since signing to Blockberry Creative.
                    They released their 2nd Japanese single Luminous in September 2022. On November 25, 2022, Blockberry
                    Creative kicked Chuu out of LOONA.
                    Blockberry stated an "abuse of power", although this has been disproven through <a
                        href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2022/11/loona-fans-and-staff-defend-chuu-against-blockberry-creatives-allegations"
                        class="songs">various sources</a>. 72
                    hours after her removal, 9 members of LOONA filed for
                    contract
                    termination and denounced Chuu's removal from the group publicly on social media. Boycotts
                    against Blockberry Creative ensued and are currently still in place. Presumably for damage control,
                    on December 12, 2022, Blockberry Creative announced LOONA's upcoming EP [0] which would
                    be released on January 3, 2023. On December 22, the EP was cancelled due to extremely low preorders
                    thanks to boycott efforts by
                    fans. The remaining 2 members filed for contract termination on February 3, 2023. As of May 2022, 6
                    members of LOONA have won injunctions to terminate their contracts with Blockberry Creative and have
                    signed exclusive contracts with Modhaus. LOONA is expected to disband sometime in June 2023. Please
                    consider supporting them as the upcoming k-pop group, <a
