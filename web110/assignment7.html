            There are many key things to know about Internet Networking. Networking is important to understand how
            connection
            works throughout different devices and mediums such as websites and sending files. Reference models allow
            for
            standardization across network devices with heterogeneous architecture. We use reference models to
            communicate
            with heterogeneous devices regardless of their architecture. An example of this is the open system interface
            which uses seven layers, each with a specific function, to serve the layer above. Additionally, transmission
            control protocol connects different networks. It handles stream delivery service, sending and receiving
            buffers,
            bytes and segments, full duplex service, connection oriented service, and reliable service. Learning about
            this
            can be useful to my future environment because I have the knowledge of how Internet connectivity works.
            Using different licenses from different operating systems comes with different support costs for Windows,
            macOS,
            and Linux. Windows license and support costs starts at $110, macOS starts at $29.99, and Linux starts at
            $349.
            They have different tiers of pricing for either a business or an individual so this is basic individual
            pricing.
            macOS is the worst value because you constantly have to wait for new updates since it is heavily reliant on
            Apple itself. Linux is the best because it is open source, making it great for web developers. This is a
            valuable lesson for the future because I understand that Linux and Windows are best for writing code.
            Setting up a home network is important, especially because we live in an age where everyone has a personal
            device
            in the home. The steps to setting up a personal network at home are to evaluate the home network hardware,
            select a wired or wireless device, connect client devices, extend the home network range, protect the home
            network, and finally, optimize network performance. I can apply this knowledge to my current environment
            because
            sometimes my network can be unreliable and this is useful to be proactive and start fixing the router
            myself.
