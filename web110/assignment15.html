            My plan after graduating with a certificate from Harper College will be to seek out a job within web
            development. I would prefer to work under a company and mainly use HTML and Javascript, but I am also
            eager to learn new techniques. My career objective is to assist clients and create beautiful websites,
            problem solve, collaborate with teams on projects, and grow my communication skills.

            While doing this assignment, I learned how to navigate and update my LinkedIn profile. Additionally, I
            learned how to properly use the div tag inside of a section! This was extremely helpful for my current
            environment because the link to my LinkedIn profile was showing up improperly in the browser and I was able
            to debug using the div tag.
