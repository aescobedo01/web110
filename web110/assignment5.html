    <p>Social networking is a very informative topic because it discusses the use and purpose of many different social
        media networks available. It can be defined as the grouping of individuals virtually, usually becoming part of a
        community in some capacity. The article lists several social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp,
        and Flickr. Most social media sites serve different purposes, Facebook and Twitter are for sharing text and
        images, Whatsapp offers free messaging and calls, and Flickr serves as an image and video hosting platform. I am
        most interested in Twitter because I can be anonymous there and the audience is vastly different from Facebook.
        The content on Twitter is much more relatable as well. This social media site can be useful in my current life
        by allowing me to regularly post updates about my life onto social media.</p>
    <p>The Twitter basics article taught me how to set up a Twitter account as well as how to navigate the app. Twitter
        is a social media app intended for short text and a few images. It is great for short news updates and easy
        reading. You can like and retweet posts onto your timeline for others to see. Hashtags are the pound symbol
        followed by text and when you click on a post with a hashtag, you can see other posts talking about the same
        topic. This is a great way to boost discussion or visibility about a certain topic. You can also read about
        different topics without using hashtags, simply by looking up a keyword in the search bar and any posts
        containing the keyword will show up. For example, looking up “corgi” should result in images or text about
        corgis. Twitter has been very helpful to my current environment by informing me on various topics via the
        trending topics section and it is my source of daily news in the morning.</p>
    <p>The article about the Honeycomb model talks about why users engage with social media content. The Honeycomb model
        is seven key building blocks and companies can select the ones that best pertain to their business, and focus on
        important functions. Some important social media building blocks are identity, presence, relationships,
        reputation, groups, conversation, and sharing. Based on their support for each of the honeycomb elements, the
        best to worst companies are Pinterest, LinkedIn, Reddit, Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and
        Snapchat. Pinterest ranks the highest because it is easy to curate your timeline and not be bombarded with
        unwanted content. Additionally, it is easy to build your reputation as a brand and creator because of the
        ability to create moodboards. The worst is Snapchat because there is no curation or moderation between messages.
        This information will be useful to my future work environment by giving me the framework for creating a great
        social media site by following the Honeycomb model.
