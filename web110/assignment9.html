    <p>
        Learning about Internet fundamentals has been very useful for me to understand how HTML works and its
        importance.
        We had to code using the HTML language for assignment 9 and 10 which taught me how to use Git, Bitbucket, and VS
        Code altogether. HTML is the standard markup language for creating a basic web page. It tells the browser how to
        display the content for the page. Web browsers read HTML language and display them properly. The structure of
        the elements typically goes HTML, head, body, h1, and p. This can be valuable to my future environment because
        group projects are done using Git and VS Code.
