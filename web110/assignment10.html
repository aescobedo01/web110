            In this assignment, we learned the basics of CSS. CSS helps stylize and customize HTML on a webpage.
            Typically,
            a seperate stylesheet must be created for CSS. In order to
            override formatting, internal css is required
            within the html file. Adding a css style attribute such as background-color would change the background
            color of
            the webpage. I can apply this knowledge to my future workspace because I now know how to customize a webpage.
