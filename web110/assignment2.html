<p>	The article about Internet fundamentals has been very informative about the customization of web browsers. The activity regarding configuring browser settings on Microsoft Edge showed me how to customize the color of my tabs on Microsoft Edge browser by going to settings, appearance, and selecting a theme. The theme appears on the tabs and around the browser window. These themes are applied to my Microsoft account so the colors will be the same by signing in on any computer. I applied this concept to my current environment by changing the tab colors from the standard setting to pink which has substantially improved my mood while using Microsoft Edge. 
	Configuring browser extensions has also been very helpful to my user experience. Extensions can improve the interface, security, accessibility, and many other features to make surfing the web a better experience. Different types of extensions can be installed for a better user experience such as one for test-taking or for blocking ads. This activity taught me how to use the Microsoft store using Edge to download UBlock Origin for preventing ads. This has been very helpful to my environment by blocking ads while watching YouTube Videos on my laptop.
	HTML5 has been interesting to learn about because it helps create accessibility in browsers. The article about HTML5 accessibility among browsers shows that Microsoft Edge has 100% accessibility on Windows 10, compared to Internet Explorer which has only 56% accessibility on Windows 10. Internet Explorer only partially supports most HTML elements such as the article and section element but cannot support the figcaption element. This is because most OS do not support or offer less support for Internet Explorer as it is now an outdated web browser. I apply this topic while doing tasks on my computer by mainly using Microsoft Edge as it does seem to operate quickly and seamlessly.</p>
