			The activity discussing Internet basics is very informative. This lesson taught me that the hyphen (-) can
			be
			added
			to any search to eliminate results with the hyphenated word. For example, I could be looking for a vegan
			chocolate
			chip cookie recipe as I am vegan. I can search for “vegan cookie recipe -egg”. This can be useful in my
			daily
			life
			because I bake often and sometimes search results are too broad. I learned that a wireless router can create
			a
			wi-fi
			network and broadcast wi-fi from the modem. I did not know that a wireless router is required to broadcast
			wi-fi
			throughout my home as I thought that it came from the modem. This can be applied in my future endeavors
			because
			I
			may open up a storefront for a business and may need to set up a wireless router to provide free wi-fi to
			customers.
			Internet technologies was very informative. The area discussing blocking spams describes how to block spam
			in
			your
			email inbox. This can be helpful because scams are becoming more advanced and difficult to discern. After
			reading
			the article, I am more aware about signing up for newsletters with my email because it can bring unwanted
			spam
			mail.
			This can be applied in my daily life by avoiding subscribing to emails from businesses. I also learned about
			Intranet and Extranet. Intranet is a system where multiple computers are connected to each other. Computers
			on
			Intranet are unavailable outside the Intranet. Extranet is a network within an organization which uses the
			Internet
			to connect with outside users in a controlled manner. Extranet is an internal network that can be accessed
			externally. Intranet is exclusively used for communication between people in a company and can not be
			accessed
			externally. This can be useful to know in the future because I may have to work using an Intranet service
			via a
			website that my company would use to send messages to the employees which cannot be accessed by
			non-employees.
			Internet connectivity was a very informative subject which discusses how the Internet connects users. An
			Internet
			service provider is a company providing access to the Internet. There are roughly six different types of
			ISPs:
			access providers, mailbox providers, hosting ISPs, free ISPs, and virtual ISps. They can also offer domain
			name
			registration. This can be applied to my future environment in case I want to start a website and register a
			domain.
			I also learned about HTTP which is a communication protocol which defines a mechanism for communication
			between
			the
			browser and the web server. It consists of lines which contain header fields, request line, and message
			body.
			HTTP
			can be useful in my future because it allows me to interact with HTTP files.
