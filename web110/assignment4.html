			Reading about email spoofing is helpful because I learned how to protect myself. Spoofing is a string of
			emails
			sent from a fake sender address intending to look legitimate. People who are deceived by email spoofing are
			usually victims of financial loss and potential malware infecting their computer. Phishing scams are a form
			of
			email spoofing. I can apply this concept immediately to my environment by carefully vetting the emails
			received
			in my inbox before opening them, typically by reading the header preview, the sender address, or any
			grammatical
			errors.
			The article titled E-mail Overview describes basic elements in an email. There are a few basic elements,
			such as
			from, date, to, subject, CC, and BCC. CC stands for carbon copy and it is used when we want to keep
			recipients
			informed but they are not the intended recipients. BCC stands for Black carbon copy and it is when we do not
			want a recipient to know that someone else was added onto the message. CC can be a helpful element in my
			future
			workspace for sending out mass work emails intended for one person but visible to all employees, for
			example,
			such as a congratulatory Employee of the Month email.
			Researching Internet mailing lists and signing up for ones that interest me has been helpful. Internet
			mailing
			lists are lists of many email addresses that can be used to send email to multiple users simultaneously. One
			popular Internet mailing list is the Ticketmaster Verified Fan list. This is a mailing list intended to
			boost
			“legitimate” fans' chances of getting tickets to a concert by sending mass emails of special presale codes.
			I
			applied this concept to my current environment by signing up for the Verified Fan list for the Twice world
			tour
			which will significantly increase my opportunities at buying tickets for the world tour.
