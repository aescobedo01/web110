            Internet safety is essential for everyone online, as it can protect you from scams, hackers, and most
            importantly, protects your personal information. One great way to protect your personal information is by
            using
            a strong password or a password manager. Ensuring the web address is correct is also important because
            scammers
            will create fake websites similar to the real websites web address. Additionally, making sure your browser
            is
            always running on the latest version is important to ensure you can safely browse. This is helpful for my
            current safety online to ensure my information is safe and I implemented these steps immediately.
            Antivirus software is also essential for your online safety. Windows and Linux are a bit more susceptible to
            viruses. I made sure to have Norton Lifelock. It protects me against potential viruses by scanning my
            computer
            system. When I did this, everything was up to date and no viruses were detected. When I did the EICAR test
            file
            and went through the steps to remove it, my computer was still functioning normally after using the Norton
            software. This was helpful to me because now I know how to save my system from any viruses in the future.
            Ensuring your browsers are up to date is very important and can contribute to your Internet security. By
            going to
            your browser settings, you can disable and enable different functions as needed. My Google browser is up to
            date, there are no unnecessary add ons, and I removed any autofill information to ensure my information is
            secure. I ensured that the memory saver was enabled to save space on my browser. Additionally, I ensured
            that
            “safe browsing” was enabled under the security tab, which will redirect me if I go to an unsafe site. This
            information is useful to my current environment because I am now safer online and can protect myself.
