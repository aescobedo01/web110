<p>Internet fundamentals talks about communication services, including file transfer, file sharing, screen sharing, and voice over IP. The Internet services tutorial discusses how Internet services allows users to access various information including sound, text, images, and software on the Internet. The four different types of Internet services include communication services, information retrieval services, web services, and the world wide web. Communication services include emails and mailing lists, information retrieval services include file transfer protocol, web services allow applications to exchange information, and the world wide web allows us to access information on Internet servers. This information is useful to my future work environment because information retrieval services will allow me to transfer files to my repository or peers.</p>
<p>Internet collaboration discusses different methods of communication online. Examples of internet collaboration include online chatting, instant messaging, internet chat relay, video conferencing, and video sharing. Video conferencing functions by allowing two-way video and audio transmissions. Multi-point control unit allows conferences to happen from two or more remote locations. A great example of this is Skype, which allows multiple people to share live video and audio at once. It is free to use and available on smartphone, tablet, and computer. To test your microphone, you can do a Skype Test Call to ensure all functions are working properly. Skype will be useful to my future environment by allowing me to make video calls to employees and have more meaningful conversations.</p>
<p>Piracy is an important topic because it constantly evolves as technology advances. Examples of piracy include downloading unauthorized versions of media or copyrighted music. There are large penalties that come with pirating media. Being charged with piracy can give you a felony record, five years in jail, and fines up to $250,000. I apply this knowledge to my current environment by ensuring that any music used for my social media posts is royalty free and not downloading pirated software onto any consoles.</p>
